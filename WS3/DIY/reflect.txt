In this Workshop, I learnt various applictions of 'class' object in c++. For Example, how to create a class, privatize it and 
how to call privatized class and store given file's data in it.
I used the codes of w3p1 project as a reference to create these modules as I found similarities between two projects
I also learnt that when allocating an object it is important to delocate it as it can potentially cause memory leaks. 
I learnt it the hard way by getting memory leak errors in matrix
